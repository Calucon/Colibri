# Colibri Unity

## Requirements

Unity 2019.4 or higher

## Installation

Put files from `assets/` folder into your own Unity project.

## Configuration

The colibri `SERVER_IP` and `APP_NAME` can be set in the file `SyncConfiguration.cs` (better configuration coming soon). Please change the `APP_NAME` from `default` to a string of your choice so that Colibri messages from your projects are not sent to other Colibri clients using the same server.
