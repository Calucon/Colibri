         *
         *  Ending a Play session destroys the singleton's GameObject but leaves the static field
         *  pointing at it. The next session has to notice that and build a new one. When it did
         *  not, the second press of Play produced a client with no connection at all: nothing in
         *  the scene, no socket, and - because handing back a destroyed object throws nothing -
         *  not one line in the console to say so.
         *
         *  Tested on singletons of their own rather than on WebServerConnection: the statics are
         *  per-T, so destroying these cannot disturb the connection the rest of the suite is
         *  using. One type per test, for the same reason - the state under test *is* the static,
         *  so sharing a type would leave whichever test runs second reading the first one's
         *  leftovers.
