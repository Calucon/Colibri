         *  The outbox.
         *
         *  Every message goes into one FIFO and is written to the socket by one drainer, so they
         *  leave in exactly the order they were sent - across an outage too. Sends used to wait
         *  on the Connected gate instead: each one issued while disconnected parked a task (no
         *  bound), and on reconnect the parked continuations resumed together on the thread pool
         *  and raced for the socket, so outage messages went out in any order and interleaved with
         *  new ones. On a last-write-wins server that let a stale position overwrite a newer one.
         *
         *  While connected the outbox is just the way to the socket and is normally empty or
         *  close to it. While not, it is the retry queue, sent ahead of anything newer as soon as
         *  the next session is connected. A message whose write failed stays at the head and goes
         *  first next time.
         *
         *  The queue is bounded during an outage, but not by dropping just anything. Broadcasts -
         *  and anything else that is not model state - are capped at MAX_QUEUED_MESSAGES, oldest
         *  dropped first. The model commands are not dropped by it, because nothing would repair
         *  the loss: a dropped model::request leaves its SyncBehaviour waiting for its first state
         *  and never sending a change, a dropped model::delete leaves the object alive on every
         *  other client, and a dropped model::update - an object that changed once early in the
         *  outage while others kept moving - is lost, and the re-request after reconnecting then
         *  even reverts it locally to the server's older copy. Instead, every model::update queued
         *  for the same object during an outage is folded into one, newer fields winning, which
         *  is exactly what a last-write-wins server would have ended up with. That keeps model
         *  state bounded by the number of objects rather than by how long the outage lasts.
         *
         *  Requests, deletes and awaited updates are not folded, though; each is queued as it is.
         *  So behind both of these sits a hard cap on the whole outbox, MAX_OUTBOX_MESSAGES, which
         *  applies while connected too: the last resort, which does drop model state rather than
         *  grow without end.
         *
         *  The folded update moves to the back of the queue, so a fold must never carry an update
         *  past something else about the same object: a newer update, a delete, or a request the
         *  server would answer without it. Such a message ends the fold for that object, and the
         *  next update starts a new one behind it; reconnecting ends every fold.
