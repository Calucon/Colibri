# colibri-unity v2.0.0: Change Log

**2.0.0, unreleased.**

Summary of everything that changed in the `1.3.1` → `2.0.0` modernization, closing out the v2
release across all three packages. `colibri-server` 2.0.0 replaced the v1 TCP framing with a fixed
binary v3 protocol (see its [change log](../colibri-server/docs/v2-changelog.md)); this release is
the Unity client's side of that change. To upgrade a 1.x project, start with
[MIGRATION.md](../MIGRATION.md), which covers all three components, then read the [Breaking
changes](#breaking-changes) below as well: among them the per-object send-rate limit, which changes
what other clients receive without failing to compile.

The ease-of-use and sync-loop pass that closes the release is written up in more depth (mechanism,
rationale, migration steps, and what the Editor verification did and did not cover) in
[`docs/v2-ease-of-use-and-performance.md`](docs/v2-ease-of-use-and-performance.md).

---

## Breaking changes

- **Protocol.** colibri-unity 2.0.0 speaks the [v3 binary TCP
  protocol](../colibri-server/docs/protocol.md) and **requires colibri-server ≥ 2.0.0**. It cannot
  talk to a 1.x server, and a 1.x client cannot talk to a 2.0.0 server. There is no version
  negotiation: both sides must be upgraded together.
- **Minimum Unity is 2022.3 LTS** (the package manifest previously claimed 2019.4 while using APIs
  that were never available there).
- **No more third-party runtime dependencies.** UniRx is gone and was not replaced;
  `SyncBehaviour<T>.ModelCreated()` and `ModelDestroyed()` are now plain
  `static event Action<SyncBehaviour<T>>` instead of observables. Anything that subscribed to them
  as `IObservable<>` has to be rewritten as `+=` / `-=`, and, unlike a UniRx subscription, a static
  event does **not** unsubscribe itself when the component is destroyed.
- **`WebServerConnection.Connected`** is a `Task` gate instead of an `IObservable<bool>`.
  `await connection.Connected` is unchanged; anything that subscribed to it is not. It completes
  once the server has sent its first frame, not when TCP connects, and it is cancelled when the
  server refuses this client's protocol version or the component is disabled. Awaiting it then
  throws `TaskCanceledException`.
- **`Store` converts values with Newtonsoft instead of `JsonUtility`.** `JsonUtility` saved public
  fields and private `[SerializeField]` fields; Newtonsoft saves public fields and properties. A
  private `[SerializeField]` field is therefore neither saved nor loaded any more: make it public
  or add `[JsonProperty]`. A `Vector3`, `Quaternion` or `Color` inside the saved class, which
  `JsonUtility` wrote as `{"x":…}`, now makes `await Store.Put(…)` throw a
  `JsonSerializationException` (for a `Vector3`, Newtonsoft follows `normalized` into itself).
  Values 1.x saved that way still load. Store such values as `float` fields or arrays, or save a
  `JObject` built with Colibri's `ToJson()`.
- **`ObservableModel<T>`, `ObservableManager<T>` and `Samples/ObservableModel` are deleted.**
- **Vendored `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` is gone**, replaced by the `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json`
  package, which is declared as a real dependency, so installing Colibri is one git URL and nothing
  else.
- **The samples are no longer compiled into your project.** `Samples/` was a live package folder, so
  every consumer built `HCIKonstanz.Colibri.Samples.*` into the Colibri assembly whether it wanted
  them or not. They now live in `Samples~`, which Unity does not compile, so those types exist only
  after the sample is imported from the Package Manager, and then they are yours, in
  `Assets/Samples/`, in `Assembly-CSharp`. Code that referenced a sample type without importing the
  sample no longer compiles. The `Prefabs` folder is unaffected and stays live: `[RemoteLogger]` and
  `[SyncTransformManager]` are still draggable straight out of `Packages/Colibri/Prefabs`.
- **`LockFreeQueue<T>` is deleted**, with `LockFreeLinkPool<T>`, `SingleLinkNode<T>` and
  `SyncMethods`, all public in `HCIKonstanz.Colibri.Networking`. It is only safe with one thread
  enqueueing, and nothing in Colibri uses it any more. Use
  `System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentQueue<T>`, which is safe with any number of producers
  and consumers.
- **Synced objects send at most 30 updates a second** by default, where 1.3.1 sent one in every
  frame in which something changed. The values in between are skipped, so a `[Sync]` setter on
  another client that counts or reacts to every value now sees gaps. A *Max Send Rate* of `0`
  sends every frame's change as before; see [SyncBehaviour and
  SyncTransform](#syncbehaviour-and-synctransform).

## v3 wire protocol

- New `Assets/Colibri/Networking/Protocol/`: `FrameCodec`, `FrameReader`, `DecodedFrame`,
  `FrameType`, `FrameException`. Pure C# with no `UnityEngine` dependency, so it is directly
  unit-testable, and a mirror of `colibri-server/src/server/modules/networking/protocol.ts`:

  ```
  [u32 LE totalLength][u8 type][body]      totalLength = 1 (type) + body.length
    0x00 heartbeat   [u64 LE pingTimestamp]
    0x01 handshake   utf8 "version::app::name"
    0x02 message     [u16 LE channelLen][channel][u16 LE commandLen][command][payload bytes]
  ```

- Encoding is one pre-sized `byte[]` per frame written with `BinaryPrimitives`, replacing the
  FlatBuffer builder plus a separately-encoded ASCII length header. Egress is bounds-checked with
  the same guards the server uses (channel/command ≤ 64 KiB utf8, whole frame ≤ 5 MiB), so this
  client can never emit a frame the server's own parser would reject.
- `FrameReader` is a growable buffer with read/write cursors: both cursors reset when it is fully
  drained (no copy), and only a trailing partial frame is ever compacted. This replaces
  `HasPacketHeader`/`GetPacketHeader` and their `\0`-scanning, which on an unrecognized byte would
  skip forward looking for the next `\0\0\0` and could resynchronize onto payload data.
- **Heartbeat/latency merge.** The server heartbeats every 100 ms and derives TCP latency purely
  from the client echoing that frame back verbatim. The client now does exactly that: the `u64` goes
  in and comes back out, never interpreted. The old `colibri`/`latency` message echo is removed;
  nothing sends that to a TCP client any more (`MeasureLatency`'s message-level ping is
  Socket.IO-only).
- **Handshake** is sent immediately after connect with `version = "2"`, matching colibri-web's
  `query: { app, version: '2' }`. The server checks it and refuses any other version (see below).
  A device or app name containing the `::` field separator, or starting or ending with `:`, is
  sanitized rather than producing a frame the server drops the connection over.
- `Assets/Colibri/FlatBuffers/` (10 files) and `Networking/Message.cs` are deleted, mirroring the
  server dropping its own `flatbuffers` dependency.

## Protocol version mismatches

- **A refused version is reported instead of retried forever.** The server checks the handshake's
  version field and refuses anything it does not speak, telling the client why on the `colibri`
  channel. `WebServerConnection` intercepts that before the message queue (it is Colibri's own
  plumbing, not an application message), logs both versions, and **stops the reconnect loop**, since
  a mismatch cannot resolve itself. New `ConnectionStatus.ProtocolMismatch` is the terminal state;
  `WebServerConnection.ServerVersion` and `.ProtocolMismatchReason` carry the detail, and
  `Window → Colibri Status` shows it in red rather than the usual (here actively wrong) "check that
  colibri-server is running" advice.
- **The refusal is final for user code too.** `Connected` is cancelled, so `await Connected` throws
  instead of waiting forever. Everything still queued is dropped, and every later send is dropped
  as it is made, with a one-time warning, instead of waiting for a connection that will never come.
  `RemoteLogging` discards its buffered lines. Disabling and re-enabling the component retries.
- `ProtocolMismatchException`, thrown internally to unwind a refused session, and public so a test
  or an application can identify it.
- **A suspected mismatch, for the case the refusal cannot reach.** A server on genuinely different
  framing (a 1.x server) cannot decode this client's frames, and this client cannot decode its, so
  no refusal can arrive. After three sessions in a row that get past the handshake and then end
  before a single frame decodes (however they end: a clean close, a reset, an undecodable frame or
  the heartbeat watchdog), the client logs that this usually means a protocol mismatch,
  `WebServerConnection.SuspectedProtocolMismatch` says the same, and `Window → Colibri Status`
  shows it as a yellow warning instead of advising you to check that colibri-server is running,
  which is the wrong advice when something is plainly answering on that port. It stays a
  suspicion: the client keeps retrying, `Status` and `ProtocolMismatchReason` remain reserved for a
  refusal actually received, and the first frame a later session decodes clears it at once. A
  session that never got as far as sending the handshake ("connection refused" from a server that is
  simply not running) does not count, so that is still reported as what it is.

## Correctness

- **The socket no longer waits for the frame.** `RunConnectionLoop` is started from `OnEnable`, so
  its first `await` captured Unity's `SynchronizationContext`, and with no `ConfigureAwait(false)`
  anywhere in the file, so did every continuation after it. Connect, receive, heartbeat echo and
  send were all posted back to the main thread and pumped once per frame: inbound bytes sat in the
  kernel buffer until the next frame, echoing a heartbeat cost two further frame-pumps *inside* the
  receive loop, and `StampLiveness` (the watchdog's proof of life) only ran when the main thread
  ran. Two editors side by side on one machine showed it plainly: Unity throttles whichever one is
  in the background, so a cube moved in the focused editor arrived in the other visibly late and its
  Status window reported missed heartbeats, all of it over localhost. Every await on the connection
  path now carries `ConfigureAwait(false)`. The `volatile` fields, `Interlocked`, `LockFreeQueue`
  and `_msgQueueLock` this file already had were written for exactly this threading; the missing
  `ConfigureAwait` had quietly been preventing it. (The receive queue has since become a
  `ConcurrentQueue`, and `_msgQueue` the outbox described below.) `_socket`, `_status` and the
  connected gate join them, and the `Status` setter (a read-modify-write over four fields now
  genuinely reachable from the connection loop and `Update`'s watchdog at once) is serialized. The
  main-thread handoff user code depends on is unchanged: received messages still arrive via
  `_queuedCommands` and are delivered from `Update`.
- **"Recent messages" stops counting up forever.** The Status window's traffic log was a static
  buffer with no expiry and no reset, timestamped with `realtimeSinceStartup`, a clock that keeps
  running after Play stops. Entries therefore aged indefinitely on screen, and with domain reload
  disabled the next session opened showing the last one's messages, dated from before it started.
  The log is cleared at `SubsystemRegistration`, entries older than ten seconds are dropped, and the
  window shows "(nothing sent or received yet)" outside Play mode.
- **The second Play session connects again.** With *Enter Play Mode Options* enabled and domain
  reload disabled (which this release recommends, so it is the configuration most projects run),
  ending a Play session destroyed the connection's GameObject but left `SingletonBehaviour<T>`'s
  "already created one" flag latched in a static that the session did not reset. Every later press
  of Play was handed back the *destroyed* connection: no object in the scene, no `Update`, no
  socket, and, because reading a destroyed reference throws nothing, not one line in the console to
  say so. The Colibri Status window's "No Colibri connection in the scene yet" was the only visible
  symptom, and it reads like an explanation rather than a fault. Liveness is now decided by the
  instance itself rather than by a flag, so a destroyed one is replaced; creation is still
  suppressed while the application is quitting, so nothing is resurrected during teardown. Affects
  `WebServerConnection` and `VoiceServerConnection` alike.
- **String payloads now round-trip.** `SendCommandAsync` used to special-case `JTokenType.String`
  and write the string *unquoted*, which is not valid JSON. Against a 2.0 server that reaches web
  clients via `Payload.asValue()`, which threw and fell back to `asString()`, so a Unity
  `Sync.Send(channel, "hello")` and a web client's version of the same message did not arrive
  identically. Payloads now always go out as `ToString(Formatting.None)` and are always parsed back
  with `JToken.Parse`, falling back to a raw `JValue` for a non-JSON body. The `log` channel is the
  documented exception: it keeps sending raw text, because `ClientLogger` reads it with
  `asString()` and quoting would put stray quotes in the admin UI.
- **Interleaved sends.** Concurrent `SendCommandAsync` calls could interleave their bytes on the
  socket and corrupt the framing for everything that followed. All writes are serialized behind a
  `SemaphoreSlim(1, 1)`, and a partial send is now completed instead of silently truncating the
  frame.
- **Send that hung forever.** `_socket.SendAsync(SocketAsyncEventArgs)` returning `false` (completed
  synchronously) never raises `Completed`, so `await signal.WaitAsync()` never returned. Replaced
  with `Socket.SendAsync(ArraySegment<byte>, SocketFlags)`, which also drops a
  `SocketAsyncEventArgs` + `SemaphoreSlim` allocation per send.
- **Messages sent during an outage.** `_msgQueue` was written from the send path and drained from
  the connect path with no synchronization. Every message now goes through one outbox: a FIFO
  written to the socket by a single drainer, so messages leave in the order they were sent, across
  an outage too, and ahead of anything sent after reconnecting. A write that fails stays at the head
  of the queue for the next session. While disconnected it holds at most 256 broadcasts and other
  messages that are not about synced objects, dropping the oldest with one warning per outage: for a
  last-write-wins sync client, an unbounded backlog only preserves updates that are already
  superseded. Log lines wait in `RemoteLogging` instead, which keeps the newest 1000 while
  disconnected (see [Dependencies](#dependencies-and-api-modernization)); only lines already handed
  over when the connection dropped count towards the 256. Model messages are not dropped by that
  bound, because nothing would repair the loss. `model::request` and `model::delete` wait as they
  are, and the `model::update`s for one object during one outage are folded into one, newer fields
  winning, but never past another message about that object, so an older value cannot overtake a
  newer one. Behind both sits a hard cap of 10 000 messages on the whole outbox, during an outage
  and while connected over a link that cannot keep up, since requests, deletes and updates that
  cannot be folded otherwise queued without limit. Past it the oldest broadcasts and log lines go
  first and then the oldest model messages, never the one being written, with one warning per
  connection.
- **`SendCommandAsync` says what happened.** It completes `true` once the message is written to the
  socket, stays pending while disconnected, and completes `false` only when the message will never
  be sent: it could not be encoded, a bound on the queue dropped it, the server refused this client,
  or the component was destroyed. It never returns `false` for a message it is still going to send.
- **Receive loop that died silently.** The `BeginReceive`/`AsyncCallback` machinery ended in
  `catch (Exception) { /* ignore */ }`, so any hiccup killed reception permanently while the client
  still looked connected. Replaced with an `await socket.ReceiveAsync(...)` loop feeding
  `FrameReader`, which logs and reconnects.
- **Static connection state.** `_socket`, `_receiveBuffer`, `_expectedPacketSize` and friends were
  `static`, which breaks under Enter Play Mode Options with domain reload disabled. All instance
  fields now.
- **Reconnect.** A single connection task with exponential backoff (0.5 s → 10 s), cancelled by a
  `CancellationTokenSource` in `OnDisable`, replaces `Update()` re-entering `Connect()` every frame
  while disconnected.
- **A connection attempt nothing answers is given up after 5 s.** The socket has no connect timeout
  of its own, so an address nothing answered on (a mistyped IP, a server on another subnet) held the
  attempt in `Connecting` until the operating system gave up, about two minutes on Android, with no
  retry and nothing in the log to say why (in 1.3.1 too). The attempt is now abandoned after 5 s and
  retried with the usual backoff, and the console says `<host>:<port> did not answer within 5 s.
  Check the server address, and that this device is on the same network as the server.
  Retrying...`. A refusal is still reported at once, as `connection to <host> failed
  (ConnectionRefused)`. New `WebServerConnection.LastConnectFailure` says why the last attempt
  failed (the timeout, a refusal or another socket error) and is `null` once a connection has
  opened; *Window → Colibri Status* shows it under *Not connected* as *Last attempt: …*. None of
  these counts towards a suspected protocol mismatch, since nothing was ever accepted.
- **Connected means the server has spoken.** A session becomes `Connected` on the first frame the
  server sends, not when the TCP connection opens. Only then is the backoff reset, `OnConnected`
  raised and the queued messages sent, so against something that accepts connections and then
  fails (a 1.x server, a port that is not Colibri), the backoff grows instead of staying at 0.5 s.
  The 2 s heartbeat watchdog covers the time before that first frame too: a server that accepts the
  connection and never says anything is dropped.
- **`OnConnected` and `OnDisconnected` come in pairs.** `OnDisconnected` is raised exactly once for
  every `OnConnected`, when that connection ends, a refusal included, and never for an attempt
  that did not connect. A refusal in the very first frame raises neither. Each handler runs on its
  own, so one that throws is logged and no longer skips the others or the rest of `Update`. The
  two are also raised in the order the transitions happened. They used to be two flags, raised
  connected-first (in 1.3.1 too), so a connection that dropped and came back before the next frame
  raised `OnConnected` and then `OnDisconnected`, and left code that follows them believing it was
  offline while it was connected.
- **Models are requested again after a reconnect.** `model::request` was sent once, when a model
  listener registered, so after a Wi-Fi blip a client kept showing old state until each object
  happened to change again. On every reconnect `Sync` now repeats the requests for every model
  channel it listens on (by id for each `SyncBehaviour`, for the whole channel for a
  `SyncBehaviourManager`) behind the messages queued during the outage, so the server answers with
  this client's own offline changes already applied. The manager updates the objects it already
  has rather than spawning duplicates.
- **One bad message no longer takes the rest of the frame with it.** A payload that cannot be read
  as the type its command names (a malformed `bool`, `int`, `float` or `string`, or an array command
  whose payload is not a JSON array) is reported once, naming the channel, the command and the
  payload, and is not delivered. A listener or `OnMessageReceived` handler that throws is logged,
  and the other listeners and the messages queued behind it are still delivered. Both used to throw
  out of `WebServerConnection.Update`.
- **A receive-only client keeps working in the next Play session.** With domain reload disabled, a
  channel registered in an earlier Play session kept its entry in `Sync` after its listeners'
  objects were gone, and registering on it again never asked for the connection, so a client that
  only listened had none. Every registration now does.
- **A colon at either end of the App Name.** It merged with the handshake's `::` separator, so app
  `app:` silently joined app `app` with the colon moved onto the client name. Such a colon is now
  replaced with `_`, with a warning for the App Name, and `FrameCodec` rejects such handshake
  fields.
- **Main-thread config reads.** `ColibriConfig.Load()` goes through `Resources.Load`; the connection
  path used to call it from a worker thread. It is now snapshotted on the main thread.
- **Voice chat.** `udpThread.Abort()` (unsupported on .NET Core / IL2CPP) is replaced with a
  `CancellationToken` plus `udpClient.Close()`, which is what actually unblocks the blocking
  `Receive()`. `OnDisable` no longer NREs when `Connect()` bailed out. The receive socket binds to
  port **0** instead of the hardcoded 9014: the server replies to the datagram's source port
  (`voice-server.ts`), so the fixed port bought nothing and capped a machine at one Unity client.
  Voice now goes to an IPv4 address of the server, since both voice sockets are IPv4: on Windows
  `localhost` resolved to `::1` first and every send failed. An IP address is no longer
  reverse-resolved (`Dns.GetHostEntry` threw for a LAN address without a DNS name), and an address
  that cannot be resolved, or has no IPv4 address, turns voice off with a clear error instead of
  throwing from `OnEnable`. Received packets now reach the main thread through a per-instance
  `ConcurrentQueue`. They went through a static `LockFreeQueue`, which is only safe with one thread
  enqueueing (and after a quick disable and enable the old receive thread may still be handing over
  a packet while the new one starts), and which, being static, could hand one connection's packets
  to the next.
- **`Store`** serializes with Newtonsoft instead of `JsonUtility`, which cannot handle dictionaries,
  properties, or top-level arrays and so silently disagreed with what `Sync` can carry. What that
  costs a 1.x project is under Breaking changes.

## SyncBehaviour and SyncTransform

- **A send-rate limit, per object.** A headset renders 72 to 120 frames a second, and every moving
  synced object sent an update in each of them: dozens of headsets, each moving a few objects,
  produced more traffic than one server and one Wi-Fi network can keep up with. Each object now
  sends at most `SyncSettings.MaxSendRate` updates a second, 30 unless configured otherwise, without
  losing what a last-write-wins client needs. A change after a quiet spell goes out in the same
  frame. Changes within the next interval are merged, and their latest values go out as soon as it
  is up, even if nothing changes afterwards, because `SyncTicker` flushes every object in every
  frame. The next slot is counted from the previous one rather than from the frame that sent, so
  72 fps still gives 30 updates a second, not 24. Switching an object off or on skips the limit and
  sends what is waiting at once, and destroying it still sends `model::delete` at once, dropping
  what was held. The setting is `ColibriConfig.MaxSendRate`, shown as *Max Send Rate (Hz)* under
  *Optional Config* in *Window → Colibri Configuration*, which warns when it is `0` (no limit) and
  refuses a negative value; a configuration saved before the field existed gets 30 without being
  saved again. `SyncSettings.MaxSendRate` changes it while the app runs, for that run only, and
  throws on a negative value.
- **What the limit holds is sent when the app stops.** `SyncTicker` sends everything waiting, past
  the limit, when the app pauses or loses focus (on Android and so on Quest the usual way out, where
  Unity may never call `OnApplicationQuit`) and from `OnApplicationQuit`. It polls every object
  first, so a change made late in the last frame is included. The send on quit or at the end of Play
  mode is best effort: the connection closes its socket in the same teardown. Losing focus while the
  app goes on running, as with a Quest's system menu, skips the limit once.
- **A value from another client replaces a local change still waiting.** A member applied from the
  server is removed from this object's update that has not gone out yet: one polled earlier in the
  frame, or held by the limit. Sent afterwards, the older local value overwrote the newer one on the
  server and on every other client while this client showed the server's, and the copies disagreed
  for good.
- **A deleted object stays deleted.** A delete from another client now drops what this client's copy
  holds and takes it off the ticker at once, rather than at its `OnDestroy` a moment later. An
  update it sent in between reached the server after the delete, and since the server creates a
  model on its first update, the object came back, on every other client too, with nobody left to
  delete it.
- **Showing and hiding.** Deactivating a `SyncTransform`'s GameObject hides its copies on the other
  clients, and reactivating it shows them again, as in 1.3.1: its `Active` member reads
  `activeSelf`, and the poll keeps running while the object is inactive, since being inactive is
  the state to sync. Received values are applied through `SetActive` and not echoed back.
  Disabling only the component (`enabled = false`) pauses its syncing, and deactivating a parent
  changes nothing elsewhere.
- **Leaving Play mode or quitting deletes nothing.** `OnDestroy` sends `model::delete` unless the
  application is quitting, and it learned that only from `OnApplicationQuit`, which Unity does not
  send to inactive GameObjects. So an object that was hidden, by this client or by another one,
  when Play mode ended or the app quit was deleted on the server, and with it every other client's
  copy (in 1.3.1 too). `OnDestroy` now also checks `Application.quitting`, which Unity raises
  whatever the object's state. Destroying an object and unloading its scene still delete it for
  everyone.
- **A value from another client no longer swallows the next local change.** Echo suppression was a
  per-member "skip the next change" flag (in 1.3.1 too). It went stale whenever the poll saw no
  change afterwards (two updates between polls that ended where they started, or any update while
  the component was disabled) and then silently dropped the next genuine local change. Received
  values are now latched as the known state instead, and `TriggerSync` sends the full state in one
  message.
- **Objects built from a disabled `Template` come to life.** A copy starts out as its template is,
  and a manager's template is often kept switched off in the scene. A copy that is switched off
  never runs `Awake`, so it never registered for its own updates or with the ticker: it stayed as
  its first update left it, never sent a change, and a `SyncTransform` hidden elsewhere could never
  be shown again (in 1.3.1 too). The manager now switches the copy on before applying the state,
  so `Awake` runs, and the state decides whether it stays visible. The member table is also built
  when the first update arrives, not only in `Awake`, so an update that reaches a model before any
  object of its type has woken is applied instead of being dropped with `Unable to sync attribute`.
- **A manager without a `Template` no longer warns at every Play.** A manager without one is how
  objects placed in the scene are synced (the `SyncTransform` sample has one), yet `Start` warned
  regardless, with a gap in the message where a model ID would have gone. It now warns once, naming
  the model, when a model arrives that is not in the scene and that it has no template to build.
- **Wire names are lowercased the same way on every machine.** Model channels and `[Sync]` member
  names used `ToLower()`, which on Turkish and Azerbaijani systems turns `I` into a dotless `ı`:
  `PhysicsId` went out under a name no other client uses, and stopped syncing. They now use
  `ToLowerInvariant()`, matching colibri-web.
- A dead prefab check in `SyncBehaviour.Awake` that compared a struct with `null` (compiler warning
  CS0472) is gone; behaviour is unchanged.

## Meta Quest and Android

- **The package compiles for Android on Unity 2022.3.** `VoiceBroadcast` subscribed to
  `PermissionCallbacks.PermissionRequestDismissed`, which only exists from Unity 2023.1 on, so every
  2022.3 project with the Android target active failed to compile (1.3.1 included). The
  subscription is now limited to 2023.1 and newer; a refused microphone permission is still logged
  on 2022.3.
- **Android build check.** With the Android target active, Colibri warns in the console after every
  domain reload, and *Window → Colibri Configuration* gets an *Android / Meta Quest* section with a
  one-click fix per problem: *Internet Access* left at *Auto*, which may leave the INTERNET
  permission out of the build, and *Allow downloads over HTTP* blocking plain HTTP to a server that
  is not `localhost` while SSL is off, which fails every `Store` call on the headset. The Setup
  window's body now scrolls.
- **No expression trees on IL2CPP.** The `[Sync]` accessors were built with
  `Expression.Compile()` (in 1.3.1 too), which IL2CPP does not compile but interprets: slowly, and
  for value types through generic code IL2CPP may not have generated. Under `ENABLE_IL2CPP` a
  property now gets open-instance delegates bound to its get and set methods, which allocate
  nothing, and a field goes through `FieldInfo.GetValue`/`SetValue`, which boxes a value type on
  every poll. Mono (the Editor and Mono players) keeps the compiled expressions. An accessor that
  cannot be built is reported per member instead of escaping from `Awake`.
- **`[Sync]` members survive managed code stripping.** Nothing references them except through
  reflection, which is exactly what stripping removes above the *Minimal* level. `SyncAttribute`
  now derives from `UnityEngine.Scripting.PreserveAttribute`, which the linker honours, and on a
  property it keeps the getter and setter too.

## Getting started

Many Colibri users know some C# and little Unity. Every silent failure costs them time they would
otherwise spend on their prototype, so:

- **Installing is one git URL.** No UniRx, no R3, no UniTask, no NuGetForUnity: the only dependency
  is `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json`, resolved automatically from `package.json`.
- **`Sync.Receive<float>("ch", MyHandler)`.** `Receive` is overloaded once per supported type,
  which made `Sync.Receive("ch", MyHandler)` ambiguous and forced a cast onto every call site. The
  generic version dispatches by pattern-matching the delegate (no reflection), and the existing
  overloads still work. Same for `Unregister<T>`. There is deliberately no `Send<T>`:
  `Sync.Send("ch", value)` already resolves, and a generic version would demote today's compile
  error on an unsupported type to a runtime message.
- **Listeners clean themselves up.** `Sync.Receive` had to be paired with a `Sync.Unregister` in
  `OnDestroy`, and forgetting it was the most expensive mistake in the API: the delegate keeps
  calling into a destroyed `MonoBehaviour`, the first line touching `transform` throws
  `MissingReferenceException`, and that exception surfaces out of `WebServerConnection.Update`,
  discarding every message still queued behind it that frame. Colibri now records which Unity object
  each listener belongs to and drops the listener once that object is destroyed. It works for a
  method group (the delegate's target *is* the component) and for a lambda written inside one (the
  component is a field of the compiler-generated closure), resolved once at registration, never per
  message. `Unregister` is unchanged and still needed to stop listening while the object lives on,
  or for a `static` listener, which has no Unity lifetime to follow.
- **Type mismatches are reported.** Colibri routes on (channel, type), so a `float` sent to a
  `string` listener used to be dropped without a word (`Sync.cs`, the missing-listener branch). The
  new `ChannelListenerRegistry` tracks which types each channel has listeners for, and the warning
  names the channel, both types, and the fix. It stays quiet for a channel with *no* listeners,
  which is normal traffic, and reports each `(channel, type)` mistake once rather than per message.
- **A missing configuration says so.** `ColibriConfig.Load()` returned `null` without
  `Resources/ColibriConfig.asset`, so `GetWebUrl` threw an NRE and the connection loop polled
  forever in silence. It now returns the defaults and reports the missing config once, pointing at
  the menu item that fixes it. The "connected" log names the host, port and **app name**, because a
  typo there produces a healthy connection on which no other client is ever seen.
- **The setup window warns about an App Name others use too**: `myAppName`, which the web client's
  samples use, and names such as `test`, `demo`, `app` or `colibri`, ignoring case and surrounding
  spaces. Everyone on a server with the same App Name is in one app, so projects that keep such a
  name see each other's objects and messages, and since every update goes to every other client
  in the app, the server's work grows with the square of the number of clients in it. The Unity
  client does not say so at runtime; colibri-server's log does, naming the app, once it has more
  than 8 clients (by default; `APP_CLIENT_WARNING_THRESHOLD`), except for `colibri`, the admin UI's
  own app. The window also no longer accepts an App Name of only spaces, and its title no longer
  forces a horizontal scrollbar.
- **`Window → Colibri Status`**: connection state, server, app name, protocol version, time since
  the last server heartbeat (not a latency: the heartbeat carries the *server's* clock), the
  channels with listeners and the type each expects, and the last 20 messages in and out. It uses
  `FindAnyObjectByType`, never `WebServerConnection.Instance`, which *creates* a GameObject.
- **Status reports the delivery rate, not just the connection.** With the socket off the main
  thread, what is left between a message arriving and user code seeing it is one frame of *this*
  client's. So the window states it: the rate `Update` is running at, the delay that implies per
  message, and below 20 fps a warning naming the usual cause: an Editor in the background, which
  Unity throttles. Without it, a client delivering at 4 fps is indistinguishable from a slow server,
  and the search goes looking on the wrong side of the wire.
- **A `Network Stress` sample, for the question the Status window cannot answer.** Status says
  whether messages are flowing; it says nothing about how many this scene can carry before it stops
  keeping up. The sample spawns up to 500 synchronized objects, moves as many of them per frame as
  you ask it to, and reports throughput, round-trip latency percentiles, dropped messages, frame
  cost and reconnects, on screen, live, with sliders. Run it in two editors side by side and turn
  the count up until the numbers stop being acceptable.

  It carries two separate instruments on purpose. The **load** is synchronized objects, which is how
  a real scene generates traffic, but state sync is last-write-wins and coalesces per frame, so a
  value that never went out is the design working and cannot be counted as loss. The panel calls
  that figure *coalesced*, not *lost*. With the send-rate limit an object's changes are coalesced
  per interval too, so *Coalesced* rises by design, and the panel's *Out* figure counts the changes
  the sample drives rather than the messages that leave; set *Max Send Rate* to `0` to measure the
  raw per-frame load. **Latency and loss** ride on a separate low-rate probe
  channel where every message is meant to arrive exactly once, measured as a round trip so no clock
  is shared between the two ends. That channel is the only thing here that can honestly report a
  dropped message, and it is what makes the server's own backpressure discard visible from inside
  Unity, since a client whose socket falls more than 1 MB behind has writes dropped without being
  told (`tcp-server-worker.ts`). `colibri-server`'s `npm run test:stressecho` is a raw v3 client
  that answers probes, so the round trip can be measured with one editor instead of two.
- **`[Sync]` members are validated at startup**: an unsupported type, a property missing an
  accessor, or two members whose lowercased names collide are reported when the model type is first
  initialized instead of failing on the first message.
- Samples and README lead with the cast-free form.
- **The samples are no longer magenta under URP.** Their objects used Unity's built-in
  `Default-Material`, whose shader belongs to the built-in render pipeline. They share
  `Materials/ColibriSample.mat` now, whose shader `Colibri/Sample Lit` draws in the built-in pipeline
  and URP alike (with the stereo-instancing macros a headset needs), without making the package
  depend on URP.

## Performance

- **The sync tick allocates nothing while idle.** `Observable.EveryValueChanged` registered one
  frame-provider work item per synced attribute per object (five for every `SyncTransform`) and
  polled through a `Func<T, object>` getter, boxing four values per object per frame. On 100 idle
  synced objects at 60 fps that is roughly 24,000 allocations and 575 KB of garbage per second
  before anything moves.
- `SyncTicker` replaces it with **one `Update` and one `LateUpdate` for the whole application**,
  iterating an index loop over its registrations. `SyncedAttribute` became a typed hierarchy whose
  per-instance tracker compares with `EqualityComparer<TValue>.Default` (the `IEquatable<>` path for
  `Vector3`/`Quaternion`), so an unchanged attribute costs a comparison and nothing else. A value is
  boxed only on the frame it actually changes, to hand it to `AddUpdate`. The one exception is a
  value-type `[Sync]` *field* on IL2CPP, which is read through reflection and boxes on every poll
  (see *Meta Quest and Android*); properties, and every `SyncTransform` member, are unaffected.
- Poll (`Update`) and flush (`LateUpdate`) are separate phases, which keeps the existing
  one-message-per-frame coalescing while removing the `async void` + `UniTask.Yield(PostLateUpdate)`
  state machine that used to allocate once per change. The flush is also where the send-rate limit
  applies (see [SyncBehaviour and SyncTransform](#syncbehaviour-and-synctransform)), so an object
  that changes in every frame sends at most 30 messages a second by default, not one per frame.
- Neither library was ever on the network path: `WebServerConnection` used raw `Socket`, `Task`,
  `SemaphoreSlim` and `FrameCodec` throughout, so removing them changed nothing there. What did
  change latency is the `ConfigureAwait(false)` work above: the socket no longer waits for the
  player loop, which is worth far more than anything on this list to a client that is not running
  at full frame rate.

## Dependencies and API modernization

- **UniRx removed, not replaced.** `IObservable<T>` subscriptions became plain methods and static
  events; `this.ObserveEveryValueChanged(f)` became the typed change tracking above;
  `RemoteLogging`'s `Observable.Start` + `WhenAll` + `ObserveOnMainThread` + `Sample()` became a
  `ConcurrentQueue` filled from Unity's threaded log callback (several threads may log at once) and
  drained by a one-second timer in `Update`. Each line is handed to the connection exactly once, and
  the connection's outbox keeps it across an outage, so nothing is retried here and no line is sent
  twice. It keeps at most the newest 1000 lines between two sends (a second's worth while connected,
  which also bounds what a runaway log loop costs the server, and the whole outage while not), and
  the next send starts with one line saying how many were dropped (`Colibri: N log lines are missing
  here …`), so a gap in the server's log no longer goes unnoticed. After a protocol refusal it
  discards them.
- **UniTask removed.** `UniTaskCompletionSource` → `TaskCompletionSource` (which also tolerates
  several pending awaiters); `await request.SendWebRequest()` → a three-line `TaskCompletionSource`
  wrapper over `UnityWebRequestAsyncOperation.completed`, completing inline so the caller stays on
  the main thread. The plain awaiter never throws, so `Store` now checks `request.result` and
  reports what failed, at which URL, with the HTTP status.
- **Legacy observable API deleted.** `ObservableModel<T>`/`ObservableManager<T>` speak
  `channel::register`/`deregister` plus bare `add`, `update`, `request` and `remove`. A 2.0 server
  registers only `broadcast::*`, `model::request`, `model::update`, `model::delete`,
  `client::request` and `latency`, so none of those commands are handled: the API was provably dead
  against the server it targets. `SyncBehaviour`/`SyncBehaviourManager` cover the same use case.
- **Deprecated Unity APIs**: `FindObjectOfType` → `FindAnyObjectByType`, `FindObjectsOfType` →
  `FindObjectsByType`, without a sort order from Unity 6000.4 on (which deprecates the overloads
  taking one) and with `FindObjectsSortMode.None` before that, so neither end of the supported
  range warns. `SyncBehaviour.Awake` also scanned the whole scene twice per `Awake` and threw one
  of the results away.
- Vendored `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` replaced by `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json`, declared as a real
  `dependencies` entry in `package.json` (which previously declared none at all).

## Tests

- New EditMode assembly `HCIKonstanz.Colibri.Tests` (`Assets/Colibri/Tests/Editor/`). The frame
  codec has no Unity dependency, so this is plain NUnit.
- `FrameReaderTests`/`FrameCodecTests` port `colibri-server/test/unit/protocol.test.ts`
  case-for-case: round trips for all three frame types, byte-by-byte fragmentation, a frame split
  across two segments, multiple frames coalesced into one segment, a complete frame plus a trailing
  partial, growth and compaction, and the malformed variants (`totalLength <= 0`, oversized, unknown
  type, channel/command length overrunning the body, handshake field-count violations).
- `ProtocolVectorTests` asserts frames hex-dumped from the server's own encoder byte-for-byte
  against `FrameCodec`. This is what catches an endianness or off-by-one drift between the two
  implementations; the round-trip tests alone would pass just as happily with both C# sides wrong in
  the same direction.
- `ChannelListenerRegistryTests` covers the type-mismatch diagnostics, including the cases where a
  message must *not* be reported. Registering a listener with `Sync` reaches
  `WebServerConnection.Instance`, which spawns a GameObject, so the registry was split out as plain
  C# to be testable without one. `MessageDispatchTests` drives `Sync`'s own dispatch, accepting the
  inert connection object that registering creates in edit mode.
- `ListenerOwnerTests` covers which Unity object a listener is judged to belong to, since that is
  what automatic unregistration hangs on: a method group, a lambda written in a component, a lambda
  nested two closures deep, and the cases that must resolve to *nothing* (a static method, a plain
  C# object, a lambda over locals) because pruning one of those would be a new bug in place of the
  old one.
- `JsonExtensionsTests` covers the conversions every inbound message passes through: both wire forms
  of a colour, integer tokens where a float is expected, and every malformed shape, each of which
  has to fall back and warn exactly once rather than throw. This is the file the colour bug lived
  in, and it had no tests at all.
- `MessageDispatchTests` covers malformed payloads of every broadcast type and a listener that
  throws; `OutboxTests` the outage queue's folding rules and that queued messages arrive in order
  over a real loopback socket; `RemoteLoggingTests` logging from many threads at once and the
  1000-line bound; `SyncAccessorTests` the IL2CPP accessor path, run in the Editor;
  `SyncStrippingTests` that `[Sync]` is a `PreserveAttribute`; `WireNameTests` the wire names under
  a Turkish culture; `AndroidSettingsCheckTests` the Android build check; and
  `VoiceServerAddressTests` the choice of the server's IPv4 address. `FrameCodecTests` also covers
  the colon at either end of a handshake field.
- New PlayMode assembly `HCIKonstanz.Colibri.E2E` (`Assets/Tests/`, in the development project
  rather than the shipped package). A real Unity client, a real colibri-server and a raw v3 peer as
  the second endpoint: the server excludes the sender from its own broadcasts, so one client can
  never observe anything it sends. It covers the handshake and heartbeat, all 17 payload shapes in
  both directions asserting the exact bytes outbound, per-member `SyncBehaviour` updates, a model
  from another client being instantiated exactly once, `SyncTransform`'s per-field switches, the
  once-only mismatch warning, the Store over REST, and the ticker invariants behind the "one
  `Update` for the whole application" claim. Without a reachable server it skips with instructions
  rather than failing.
- `LifecycleTests` additionally pins what a singleton does once the previous Play session's instance
  has been destroyed: it must be rebuilt, not handed back. The bug this replaces produced no
  exception and no log line of any kind, so nothing short of asserting the invariant directly would
  have caught it. The assertions run against a singleton declared for the test rather than against
  `WebServerConnection`, since the statics are per-type and destroying the real connection would
  pull it out from under the rest of the suite.
- `ConnectionTests` pins the threading. The one that matters blocks the main thread outright for a
  second and then asserts the last heartbeat is still under half a second old, proof the socket is
  being serviced by something other than the player loop. It is deliberately the symptom the bug
  report described rather than a check for `ConfigureAwait` in the source, so it stays honest if the
  mechanism ever changes; a companion asserts the receive loop's thread is not the main one, which
  is the same fact stated the other way round. A third covers traffic entries ageing out of the
  Status window's log.
- `ReconnectTests` cut the Unity client's connection mid-session through a `TcpProxy`, while the raw
  peer stays connected, and pin the outage queue end to end: messages arriving in order ahead of
  newer ones, the bound with its single warning, every object's latest state with its requests and
  deletes, the models requested again after reconnecting, and `RemoteLogging` delivering each line
  once. `ProtocolMismatchDetectionTests` walk the client through scripted sessions against a
  `FakeColibriServer` that hangs up, stays silent, heartbeats or refuses: the growing backoff, the
  suspected mismatch and what clears it, the watchdog before the first frame, a refusal in the
  first frame, and the pairing of `OnConnected` and `OnDisconnected`. `SyncTransformTests` cover
  hiding, showing and deleting, including an object hidden when this client quits; `SyncModelTests`
  a value from another client followed by a local change; `LifecycleTests` a listener registered
  after the connection was rebuilt.
- The send-rate limit, the connect timeout and the outbox cap have tests of their own. In EditMode,
  `SendRateTests` drive the limit on a clock of their own: the leading edge, a burst, the held
  update going out when its interval is up, 30 a second at 72, 90 and 120 fps, a limit of `0`,
  showing and hiding, a server value replacing a held change, a delete from another client
  dropping it, and where the limit comes from. `ModelUpdateTests` cover an update reaching a model
  before any object of its type has woken; `AppNameCheckTests` the shared-app-name warning;
  `ConnectTimeoutTests` an attempt nothing answers, cancelling one, and a refusal reported at
  once; `VoicePacketQueueTests` voice packets from several receive threads at once; `OutboxTests`
  the 10 000-message cap, connected and not; `RemoteLoggingTests` the missing-lines note. In
  PlayMode, `SyncModelTests` and `SyncTransformTests` run the limit end to end (a burst, a limit of
  `0`, what is held going out on quit, pause and focus loss, a destroy and a delete from another
  client, hiding a moving object) and objects built from a disabled template, visible and hidden;
  `ReconnectTests` a drop and reconnect within one frame and the missing-lines note;
  `ProtocolMismatchDetectionTests` an attempt nothing answers, given up after 5 s and retried.
  `FakeColibriServer` now stays silent until it has read the handshake, as colibri-server does;
  its old behaviour, heartbeating before it has read the handshake and refusing after, is kept as
  `HeartbeatThenRefuse`.
- The tests that need a port that never answers are skipped on Windows, which refuses a
  connection to a full listen backlog instead of leaving it unanswered:
  `ConnectTimeoutTests.AnAttemptNothingAnswersIsGivenUpAfterTheTimeout` and
  `.CancellingGivesUpTheAttemptAtOnce`, and
  `ProtocolMismatchDetectionTests.AnAttemptNothingAnswersIsGivenUpAfterFiveSecondsAndRetried`.
  There, check the timeout by hand: with an unreachable server address, the client should leave
  *Connecting* after 5 s.
- `node colibri-unity/run-tests.mjs` runs both suites, starting and stopping a server with
  `docker compose`, unless one is already listening, which it uses as it stands. See
  [README.md](README.md#for-maintainers).
- The cross-implementation protocol vectors are checked automatically: `npm run test:vectors` in
  colibri-server re-encodes each one and fails if `ProtocolVectorTests.cs` no longer expects the
  same bytes. It also fails when `WebServerConnection`'s `CLIENT_VERSION` differs from the server's
  protocol version, so bumping one side alone cannot go unnoticed. It runs in the server's CI
  workflow, which also triggers on changes to the C# vectors and to
  `colibri-unity/Assets/Colibri/Networking/`.
- Still no GameCI workflow: the Unity suites run locally, since a Unity container in CI needs a
  licence secret. Voice chat has no end-to-end coverage (it needs a microphone); only the choice of
  the server's address and the queue that hands received packets to the main thread are
  unit-tested.

## End-to-end verification, and what it fixed

The Editor acceptance criteria for the release were run on 2026-08-05: Unity 6000.5.7f1, a
URP-template project with Colibri as a `file:` UPM package, against `colibri-server` 2.0.0 built and
run locally. The EditMode suite came back **52 passed, 0 failed**, and the server's own suite was
green at 102. The other end of every message-level exchange was a Socket.IO peer written against
colibri-web or a raw v3 TCP client, with a pass-through proxy in front of the TCP port decoding every
frame in both directions, because that is what makes the bytes quotable. A development Windows 64-bit
player was also built from the same project (`result=Succeeded errors=0 warnings=13 time=00:01:59`)
and run alongside the Editor with both clients connected to the same app at once and no
`FrameException` in the player log: the configuration the old hardcoded voice port and the old
`static` socket fields would have broken. The visual half of that is still unconfirmed: nobody
watched an object in one client follow an object in the other, since the player's scene state is not
observable from outside its process. The type-mismatch warning fires once for 60 offending
messages rather than once each, and the `SyncBehaviour` sample propagates private `[Sync,
SerializeField]` fields, public fields and properties alike, instantiates its template for a
remote-created model, and recovers that model from server state as a late joiner: one instance, not
a duplicate. The leak check is the one that found a defect rather than confirming a claim; it is the
last fix below. The headline performance claim was measured rather than argued: 100 idle
`SyncTransform`s with Deep Profile off gave a median frame of **0 bytes** of GC allocation over a
231-frame window, and exactly one `SyncTicker.Update()` on the main thread attributed to the single
`[Colibri SyncTicker]` object (0.335 ms of a 0.786 ms `PlayerLoop`), so the idle poll allocates
nothing but is not free of time. All ten criteria are addressed; what the pass did not touch is voice
chat and the visual half of Unity ↔ Unity. Item-by-item results are in §8 of
[`docs/v2-ease-of-use-and-performance.md`](docs/v2-ease-of-use-and-performance.md).

The fixes it produced:

- **The `SendData` sample never round-tripped its JSON.** `SendMessages` sent its `JObject` on the
  literal channel `"myJson"` while listening on `Channel`, so the one payload type that most needs
  demonstrating was the one that appeared not to work. It sends on `Channel` now.
- **Samples moved to `Samples~`, and `Prefabs` left `samples[]`.** As live package folders they were
  compiled into every consumer *and* offered for import, so Package Manager → Import produced a
  second copy of everything: importing `SendData` the way the README says logged a GUID conflict
  against `Packages/de.uni.kn.colibri/Samples/SendMessages/SendMessages.cs`, left two definitions of
  `HCIKonstanz.Colibri.Samples.SendMessages` (one in `Assembly-CSharp`, one in
  `HCIKonstanz.Colibri`) and two copies of every scene. Not a hard compile error, but any user code
  naming the type was ambiguous. After the move: zero sample types in the package assembly, and a
  re-import yields exactly one `SendMessages.unity` with no GUID warnings. See the breaking-change
  note above. The tradeoff, as expected, is that the `colibri-unity` dev project can no longer open
  the sample scenes in place; they are opened from a consuming project now.
- **Stale `SyncTransform` sample assets.** `SyncTransformSample.unity` carried a dead
  `propertyPath: Channel` override (`synctransform_CUBE`) that no longer corresponds to anything, and
  `CubeModelTemplate`/`SphereModelTemplate` predate the `SyncActive` and `UseLocalTransform` fields.
  Both are updated, so the scene demonstrates the component as it currently exists.
- **Colour did not round-trip, and took the frame down with it.** Unity writes a colour as the HTML
  string `#RRGGBBAA` (which is what colibri-web's `receiveColor` is typed for), but colibri-web's
  `sendColor` puts an `[r,g,b,a]` array on the wire. A colour from a web client arrived as
  `InvalidCastException: Cannot cast JObject to JToken` out of `JsonExtensions.ToColor`, and because
  that escaped `WebServerConnection.Update` unhandled it also dropped every message queued behind it
  that frame. `ToColor` accepts either form now, and all of the vector, quaternion and colour
  conversions report a wrong-shaped payload as a warning naming the type and the expected shape
  instead of throwing. A web client's `[1, 0.5, 0.25, 1]` now arrives as
  `RGBA(1.000, 0.500, 0.250, 1.000)`. colibri-web's own `sendColor`/`receiveColor` asymmetry is left
  as it is on purpose: changing the wire format would move behaviour under existing web-only users,
  and Unity copes with both forms.
- **Integers sent from Unity were dropped by web clients.** `Sync.Send(channel, 5)` goes out tagged
  `broadcast::int`, but colibri-web's `receiveNumber` only listened for `broadcast::float`.
  JavaScript has a single number type, so there was nothing to distinguish and every integer a Unity
  client sent vanished without a trace. Fixed in colibri-web: `receiveNumber` and
  `receiveNumberArray` listen for both commands, with its 108 tests still passing.
- **The status window's heartbeat readout counted down.** `MillisSinceLastHeartbeat()` is a 0-100 ms
  sawtooth and the window repaints at 10 Hz, so the raw sample beat against the server's heartbeat
  and read like a timer running out. It now peak-holds the worst gap over a one-second window, which
  is steady and is the number that actually indicates trouble.
- **`Store` waited forever.** `UnityWebRequest.timeout` defaults to no timeout, so on an unconfigured
  project (where `ServerAddress` still points at the public `colibri.hci.uni-konstanz.de`),
  `Store.Get` neither threw nor logged, and was still outstanding after a minute. The detailed
  failure log added in this release only runs when the request finishes, so `Get`/`Put`/`Delete` now
  set a ten-second timeout: long enough for a slow link, short enough that the failure is reported
  while the developer is still looking at the console.
- **`SyncTicker` leaked one GameObject per Play session, and they all ticked.** With *Enter Play Mode
  Options → Disable Domain Reload* on, three enter/exit cycles left one extra `[Colibri SyncTicker]`
  behind each time; measured outside Play mode the Editor had collected seven, all still enabled:

  ```
  live SyncTicker components (outside Play mode): 7
    go='[Colibri SyncTicker]' hideFlags=DontSave activeSelf=True enabled=True scene='' valid=False
    ... x7
  ```

  `HideFlags.DontSave` exempts an object from Play-mode teardown as well as from being saved, and
  `DontDestroyOnLoad` was already covering the saving half by itself. The stale object is not the
  real cost: every ticker drives the same static `_tickables` list, so the n-th Play session ran
  `PollChanges` and `FlushUpdate` n times per frame, with duplicate `model::update` messages on the
  wire and a sync cost that grew each time someone pressed Play, which is the direct contradiction
  of the one-`Update`-for-the-whole-application claim above. The flag is gone and `ResetState`
  destroys strays first, so an Editor that already accumulated them recovers on the next Play.
  Afterwards: zero tickers alive outside Play mode, three cycles holding steady, and the 52 EditMode
  tests still green.

  ```
  LEAK syncedBehaviours=4 connections=1 tickerObjects=1 tickables=4
  LEAK syncedBehaviours=3 connections=0 tickerObjects=1 tickables=3
  LEAK syncedBehaviours=3 connections=0 tickerObjects=1 tickables=3
  ```

  (The first cycle counts four because the late-joined remote model had already arrived when the
  probe ran.) `ColibriTest` was left with *Disable Domain Reload* enabled, since that is the
  configuration this check requires.

## Known residuals

- Disabling a `SyncBehaviour` component (`enabled = false`) pauses its syncing: it neither polls
  nor sends, and changes made while it was disabled go out as ordinary changes the frame it comes
  back. Deactivating its GameObject does not pause it, since for a `SyncTransform` the active state
  is itself synced. In 1.3.1, whose change observation ran until the object was destroyed
  (`TakeUntilDestroy`), a disabled component kept syncing.
- After a reconnect, the re-requested models bring in what other clients changed, but not what they
  deleted: an object deleted elsewhere during the outage stays on this client.
- The server forgets an app's models when the app's last client disconnects (a single client whose
  connection drops is that last client) and when it restarts. Clients do not send their objects'
  full state again afterwards, so the server learns each object again only from its next change,
  and then only the members that changed.
- `SyncBehaviourManager` must unsubscribe from `SyncBehaviour<T>.ModelCreated` / `ModelDestroyed` in
  `OnDestroy`, since static events do not do it themselves. It does; anything else subscribing to
  them has to as well, or it leaks across Play sessions when domain reload is disabled.
- A `static` listener, or one owned by a plain C# object, stays registered into the next Play session
  when domain reload is disabled: `Sync`'s listener dictionaries are statics, and neither of those
  has a Unity lifetime to be dropped by. Listeners belonging to a Unity object clean themselves up,
  which covers the ordinary case. Clearing the dictionaries at startup would fix it and break a
  listener registered from a `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod]` hook, so it is left as it is.
- A `[Sync]` array changed **in place** is not detected: the comparison is by reference, as it was
  in 1.3.1. Assign a new array to sync it.
- On IL2CPP, a value-type `[Sync]` field is read through `FieldInfo.GetValue`, which boxes on every
  poll; there is no allocation-free way to read a field through reflection without a JIT. A
  property is read through a delegate and allocates nothing, so a frequently synced value-type
  member is cheaper as a property. Attribute construction dispatches through an explicit per-type
  `if` chain rather than `MakeGenericMethod`, which keeps every instantiation visible to the AOT
  compiler.
- `Store` logs and returns `default`/`false` only for a failed request. A value Newtonsoft cannot
  convert throws out of the `await` instead: on `Put`, a class holding a `Vector3`, `Quaternion` or
  `Color`; on `Get`, a saved value that does not fit the requested type (a `JsonException`).
- Every `SyncBehaviour<T>` registers its own listener on its type's channel, so each inbound
  `model::update` is offered to every instance of that type. With every object changing, the cost
  of applying a frame's updates therefore grows with the square of the number of objects. The
  `Network Stress` sample is there to measure where that starts to matter.
- What the send-rate limit still holds when the app quits, or Play mode ends, is handed to the
  connection during the same teardown that closes its socket, so it may not arrive. Pausing and
  losing focus, which is how an Android or Quest app is usually left, send it while the connection
  is still open.
