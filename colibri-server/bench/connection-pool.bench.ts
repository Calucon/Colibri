// Mirrors main.ts: 7 command-hook classes each register interest in messages once at
// startup. The Phase 0 baseline (bench/baseline.md) measured the old `messages$` getter,
// where each of the 7 subscribers independently rebuilt merge(...of every transport's
// messages$) - 7 independent merge/filter chains evaluated per message. Phase 1 item 14
// replaces that with a single merge() subscription in the constructor dispatching through
// onCommand's Map<command, handlers[]>.
//
// Setup (constructing the pool and registering handlers) happens once, outside the timed
// bench() callback, so this isolates steady-state dispatch cost from one-time constructor
// work - that construction cost isn't part of the hot path this item targets, and folding
// it into the timed loop would conflate the two. This differs from how the Phase 0 number
// for this file was measured (it built a fresh pool per timed iteration), so the two
// numbers aren't directly comparable - see bench/baseline.md's Phase 1 item 14 section.
