 * debounced save runs, and a voice recording only fails when it is saved. In Docker this is the
 * normal way to get it wrong - the server runs as uid 1000, while a host directory that Docker
 * creates for a bind mount, or the data/ that colibri-server 1.x left behind, belongs to root.
 * The server keeps running either way; it just cannot keep anything past a restart.
